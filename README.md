Modern Navbar
A classic navigation bar designed and crafted years ago during the early stages of my coding journey.
his project showcases one of my initial forays into web development, 
featuring a simple and stylish modern navbar implemented with HTML and CSS.

Feel free to customize it further based on your preferences or to add any additional information you find relevant.
